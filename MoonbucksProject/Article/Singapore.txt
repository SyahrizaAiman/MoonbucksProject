SINGAPORE: Dark clouds are gathering on the horizon for Singapore’s economy as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and strict COVID-19 lockdowns in China exacerbate supply chain snarls and fuel further price increases.“The road ahead remains bumpy,” said OCBC’s chief economist Selena Ling.Already, the economy logged a slower pace of growth during the first three months of the year.Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.7 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) showed on Wednesday (May 25). This was higher than the Government's advance estimate of 3.4 per cent, but much slower than the 6.1 per cent growth in the previous quarter.Quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted figures paint a similar picture as the economy expanded by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter, pulling back from the preceding quarter’s 2.3 per cent growth.MTI also said on Wednesday that it will maintain its full-year economic forecast at 3 to 5 per cent, but warned that 
growth is more likely to come in at the lower half of this range due to a deterioration in the external economic environment.BREWING HEADWINDS One major risk is a potential economic slowdown in China, which MTI flagged as having a direct impact on some of Singapore’s outward-oriented sectors like the chemicals cluster.Manufacturing, which accounts for about one-fifth of the local economy and has been a key driver of Singapore’s recovery thus far, will also be hit, noted DBS senior economist Irvin Seah.“Amid spikes in domestic infections (and) the resulting lockdowns in key cities, domestic demand from within China has softened while supply chains in the region have been severely disrupted,” he said.“This will have profound implications on the prospects of Singapore’s manufacturing sector.”Downside risks for manufacturing are already emerging, added Mr Seah, pointing to how the sector contracted marginally in the first quarter on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis. This mark
s the sector’s first decline in a year.Related:

Singapore maintains 2022 growth forecast at 3-5%, expects growth to be at 'lower half' of this rangeIs a global recession coming and what does that mean for Singapore?Other risks include the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has pushed up the prices of everything from energy to food, and the prospect of weaker global growth as major central banks step up policy tightening to fight inflation.Altogether, these global headwinds are likely to “douse (Singapore’s) recovery and undercut growth by the second half of the year”, said Maybank economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye.Then, there is inflation which has run up to decade-highs in recent months and is likely to stay elevated, no thanks to higher commodity prices, continued supply chain disruptions and a tight labour market.A recent development – Malaysia’s ban on the export of chickens from Jun 1 – will exacerbate inflationary pressures, said Mr Seah.This as food accounts for about one-fifth of Singapore’s consumer price basket, according t
o Ms Ling, who is also OCBC’s head of treasury research and strategy. While meat, including poultry, accounts for only about 1 per cent of the basket, the prices of other components ranging from eggs to cooking oil have already gone up, she said.Persistently high inflation may weigh down on spending as consumers feel the squeeze, economists said.Also expecting a continued rise in Singapore’s core inflation, JPMorgan’s economic and policy research analyst Ong Sin Beng flagged the risk of real incomes possibly coming under pressure.“This is a risk to what is otherwise a fairly constructive view of the domestic recovery,” he wrote in a note.





SplitText SINGAPORE: The Singapore economy grew by 3.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter of 2022, moderating from the 6.1 per cent expansion in the previous quarter, the republic’s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said.In releasing the republic’s Economic Performance in First Quarter 2022 today, the ministry also maintained the 2022 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast at 3.0 to 5.0 per cent, with expansion likely to come in at the lower half of the forecast range.On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the republic’s economy expanded by 0.7 per cent, slower than the 2.3 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.On sector performances, the manufacturing sector, among others, increased by 7.1 per cent year-on-year, extending the 15.5 per cent growth in the previous quarter."Growth during the quarter was supported by output expansions in the electronics, transport engineering, general manufacturing and precision engineering clusters, which o
utweighed output declines in the biomedical manufacturing and chemicals clusters,” it said.The construction sector rose by 2.1 per cent year-on-year, easing from the 2.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter, as both public and private sector construction activities picked up during the quarter.The transportation & storage sector surged by 5.9 per cent year-on-year, a moderation from the 7.5 per cent growth clocked in the fourth quarter."Within the sector, the air transport segment saw a strong pickup in activity as the number of air passengers handled at Changi Airport rose sharply following the further easing of border measures,” the MTI said.The finance & insurance sector, meanwhile, expanded by 4.0 per cent year-on-year, moderating from the 5.6 per cent expansion in the previous quarter.As for the Economic Outlook for 2022, the MTI said since February, the external economic environment has deteriorated, due in part to the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.In particular, the mi
nistry said the conflict has disrupted the global supply of energy, food and other commodities, which has in turn exacerbated global inflationary pressures and adversely affected the growth of many economies.Meanwhile, stringent measures implemented in China to contain its domestic COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to weigh on its economy and contribute to global supply bottlenecks."Consequently, global supply disruptions are projected to be more severe and prolonged than earlier expected, potentially persisting throughout 2022,” it said.In the US, the MTI said GDP growth is projected to moderate in 2022 while the growth outlook of the Eurozone economy has weakened due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.As for the growth of Southeast Asian economies such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, the ministry projected them to improve in 2022.It will be supported by a pickup in domestic demand with the easing of public health measures in these economies, as well as sustained demand for their merchan
dise exports, the MTI said.Domestically, the MTI noted that there are sectors in the Singapore economy which have seen a strengthening of their growth outlook, among others, the electronics cluster.The cluster is expected to expand more strongly than earlier projected, bolstered by robust global demand for semiconductors from the 5G and automotive markets, as well as cloud services and data centres, it said.Taking into account the performance of the Singapore economy in the first quarter, as well as the latest global and domestic economic developments, the MTI said it "continues to expect the Singapore economy to grow by 3.0 to 5.0 per cent in 2022, although growth is now more likely to come in at the lower half of the forecast range. - Bernama





SplitText SINGAPORE — Singapore is set to reopen its international borders and ease Covid restrictions next week, and that's going to be its "biggest economic driver for growth," according to Brian Tan, senior regional economist at Barclays."By our estimates, if we get mobility at places like recreational areas and workplaces going up by just 10%, you're going to get growth of about 3% to 4% of GDP. That's a fairly big jump," Tan said on CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Friday.Starting March 29, people will be able to gather socially in groups of 10 instead of the current 5-person limit. More employees will be able to return to offices and capacity limits for large events will also be increased, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced Thursday."We're also expecting that the resumption of international travel … there's a gap of about 4% of GDP that could potentially be filled," Tan added.A survey of 12,000 travelers by Expedia found that Singapore residents were the least like
ly to have traveled during the pandemic (59%) and the most likely to want to splurge (43%) on their next trip.

Analysts from research firm Capital Economics and DBS Bank also said on Friday they are expecting MAS to tighten policy at its meeting next month following the listing of restrictions."We think that is going to be positive for the currency," Tan said.We're 'quietly confident' in dealing with omicron wave, says Singapore minister Squawk Box AsiaThe Singapore dollar was trading at $1.356 Singapore dollars against the greenback. Singapore's benchmark index, the Straits Times' Index, was 0.5% higher on Friday, a day after the slew of announcements on easing measures.All fully vaccinated travelers and non-fully vaccinated children aged 12 and below can also enter Singapore without having to apply for entry approvals starting April 1.Tan added that the reopening of borders will pave the way for a "good macroeconomic outlook" in Singapore, by helping to attract more foreign direct investments."The fact that we are able to reopen ahead of some of the other economies in Asia also suggests that 
it cements some of the safe haven status that Singapore has."





SplitText SINGAPORE - The Republic will strive to make the best out of opportunities presented by a volatile and fast-changing global economy, said Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong on Monday (April 25).He said the Government has developed various plans, such as the Singapore Economy 2030 vision and the Industry Transformation Maps, and has engaged its trading partners through a network of bilateral and multilateral agreements to face the rising challenges.But the success of these strategies and trade deals will depend on how aggressively Singapore businesses pursue the opportunities presented by them, Mr Gan said, speaking at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) Firefly Symposium at Suntec Hybrid Experience Centre, held in collaboration with the Singapore Tourism Board."We need to achieve deep industry and business transformation, and build a strong bench of Singapore enterprises that can create good careers for our people."The minister said that some businesses have questi
oned the need for transformation at a time when costs are rising and workers with the right skills to support the companies' daily operations are in short supply."Actually, the only sustainable way to address these challenges is to relentlessly push on innovation and transformation," he said.The minister agreed that the global environment is filled with uncertainties. In the near to medium term, businesses will face heightened inflation, constrained supply and volatile geopolitics.The war in Ukraine has sent shockwaves throughout the global economy, further straining and disrupting supply chains, and driving up prices of energy, food and industrial commodities.But businesses should not lose sight of longer-term trends and structural shifts that are reshaping the global economic landscape, he said."Against this backdrop of rising challenges, we continue to see many growth opportunities, and Singapore is well positioned to seize them."He said local businesses should seek to benefit from 
new economic partnerships and trade pacts such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and various new free trade agreements and digital economy pacts.He also highlighted opportunities in the United States-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and the US-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation, China's Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, South Korea's New Southern Policy Plus and Japan's Investing for the Future Initiative.Singapore is also investing heavily to capture value from secular trends of digital technology and sustainability that should boost productivity and lessen dependence on a large workforce."Companies need to innovate, build deep capabilities and pivot their business models where needed, to respond to industry trends, open up new revenue streams and leapfrog the competition."Our companies will need to be nimble in pivoting their processes, workers and even their entire bus
iness models, to seize these opportunities," he said.He said all of these initiatives must be paired closely with workforce transformation, which will require not only commitment and investment from companies, but also the willingness of workers to learn new knowledge and skills, and take on new responsibilities.

Will a labour shortage crimp Singapore's post-pandemic recovery?Economists keep S'pore's growth forecast but inflation, Ukraine crisis threaten outlook: MAS pollSingapore Business Federation (SBF) chairman Lim Ming Yan said SBF seeks to help bring the Singapore Economy 2030 vision to fruition, in partnership with the government, the union, businesses, and trade associations and chambers."We will do so through initiatives under our three strategic pillars, namely internationalisation; digitalisation and transformation; and jobs and skills," he said.The Ministry of Manpower, Economic Development Board and Enterprise Singapore also gave presentations to highlight their efforts and initiatives in line with the 2030 vision.

Announced by Mr Gan last month, the 2030 economic plan aims to put Singapore industries, enterprises and workers on a firmer footing for long-term, sustainable growth over the next decade.

MTI targets to raise Singapore's export value from $805 billion in 2020 to at least $1 trillion by 2030. It also wants Singapore to capture more re-exports and transshipment flows, and expand trade with more economies with deeper connections in global supply chains.





SplitText In May 2019, IMD issued the last World’s most competitive economies and Singapore ranked first. Now, what are the factors that allowed an island city-state, in Southeast Asia, to go from a developing country to a developed country and from it to the most competitive economy in roughly one generation period of time?There are many factors that justify the sky rocketing development of Singapore. The Economist identifies three main factorsThe strategic location of the island, just suspended in the Malacca Strait that guarantees the control on 40% of trading passes.he friendly policies adopted by the government towards foreign investments.An efficient and “honest” government.From these three reasons, only one is actually a real competitive advantage. In fact, many other economies are located in strategic locations (also in the same Malaysia), but they fail to fully take advantage of such a favorable position. The fact that Singapore is able to control 40% of maritime trade is not 
a cause of its success, but rather a consequence. It’s because Singapore “is good for business” that ships sail there!Also, being friendly with foreign investors is the policy of other economies that, despite their efforts, fail to have as many friends as Singapore. We are left with one choice: the true key of Singapore’s success lies in its efficient and honest government.The economics literature points out that the form of government might not have an impact on economic growth. That is to say that there is no reason to believe that authoritarian governments are less effective in promoting growth than liberal government. What actually matters is not the form of the government, but rather the stability that this government is able to provide (Alesina et al., 1996).Close link between economic growth and political stability. e history of Singapore is a clear example of the close link between economic growth and political stability. In fact, after the independence of Singapore in 1965, th
e first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was able to give to the new born Republic of Singapore the stability needed in 1969. The island's stability comes from the fact that its legal system is “clear, secure and efficient”. In legal terms, this implies that the consequences attached to the laws are predictable for everyone (clear), the law does not constantly change but it is rather reliable (secure) and it is enforced all the time (efficient). These three key elements generate the required stability that attract investors. Indeed, investors are by their own nature risk-averse. They do not like when the rules of the game are unclear, mutable and enforced depending of the discretion of someone. Therefore, they very much like Singapore.A strong education system supporting economic growth. wever, there might be an additional reason that has been neglected so far. If what stands above is true (and we claim it is), it is still not the complete picture for Singapore's success. Other countries ha
ve a well enforced law system but, despite doing well, they do not rank first in the IMD world competitiveness ranking.To understand the success of Singapore, we can refer to a metaphor taken from horse racing. In horse racing, the expression win by a nose means that in case of two or more close competitors that are very likely, win the one that is able to put is nose first. Then, what is the nose of Singapore?Well, to understand it, we should refer to another ranking: the PISA Worldwide Ranking that assess the education system of different countries. And who is the first in that Ranking? That’s right: Singapore! The “nose” of Singapore is the education system and its contribution to economic growth. Education contribution is double folded: on one hand, education provides skilled workers with a higher marginal productivity of labor (with obvious consequences on the GDP). On the other hand, as Lucas (1988) pointed out, education provides positives externalities. A positive externality i
s a benefit that a party has without paying for it. In plain English, when we invest in education, we consider only our individual benefits out if. However, once we are finally educated, this education generates also a benefit for the whole society.For instance, given our knowledge, we will be more likely to set up a profitable business that would, in return, give a job to other people. Giving a job to another person was not our initial intention. Our initial intention was to invest in education to have a successful career. It turns out that by doing so, other people benefits of our education. Now, Singapore has invested greatly in education. According to the BBC, Singapore put an effort to increase the prestige of teaching, recruited teachers “from the top 5% graduates in a system that is highly centralized” and trained teachers in order to secure quality control on education. bviously, this could not have been done without a well-established government. A government that can guarante
e security, avoid corruption and enforce the law. However, a well-established, law enforcing government alone cannot guarantees the success, not up to the one “earned” by Singapore. The government should also be benevolent in recognizing what stands at the heart of the success for an island without row material that can count only on its-own. And that is education. And that, it is, the true spell of magic that relies behind Singapore success.
